# AdventOfCode2022

This year, i made my solutions with vue/typescript.  
The design is heavily inspired by <https://adventofcode.com/>

My solutions to the puzzles are under [/src/solvers](https://github.com/SlayerSvamp/AdventOfCode2022/tree/main/src/solvers)

I have published the application with github pages:  
<https://slayersvamp.github.io/AdventOfCode2022/>

P.S. Maybe it's obvious, but this is the first project I've done in Vue.
